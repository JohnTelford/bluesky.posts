The Gartner Hype Cycle is a graphical representation developed by Gartner in 1995.

It illustrates the maturity, adoption, and social application of specific technologies over time.

It serves as a valuable tool for understanding how emerging technologies evolve through various phases of public perception and market readiness.

I am an technology information junkie. The hype-cycle helps me guess the state of a technology or company.

## Phases of the Hype Cycle

The Hype Cycle consists of five distinct phases:  

### Innovation Trigger: 

- This phase marks the emergence of a new technology Initial interest begins by early demonstrations or breakthroughs, but there are often no usable products yet available.

### Peak of Inflated Expectations:  

- During this phase, media coverage and public interest peak. Many organizations begin to experiment with the technology, leading to inflated expectations about its potential benefits.

### Trough of Disillusionment:

- As the limitations and challenges of the technology become apparent, interest wanes. Many projects fail or are abandoned, leading to skepticism about the technology’s viability.

### Slope of Enlightenment: 

- In this phase, more organizations start to understand the technology’s true potential. Development continues, and successful case studies emerge, leading to more realistic expectations.

### Plateau of Productivity:

- Finally, the technology reaches maturity. It becomes widely adopted and integrated into business practices, demonstrating clear benefits and established best practice and updates.
